## About Me

I'm a Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls">University of Edinburgh</a> working with <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/sarah-e-macpherson">Sarah MacPherson</a>. You can read about my project **GRASP: Greater Awareness of Social Pragmatics in Ageing** below.

Prior to this, I was a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.mpi.nl">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics</a> (examining multimodal communication in interactive settings using portable eye-tracking with <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/people/rubio-fernandez-paula">Paula Rubio-Fernández</a> and <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/people/ozyurek-asli">Aslı Özyürek</a>) and a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.uio.no/english/">University of Oslo</a> (exploring referential communication across the lifespan, across clinical and non-clinical populations, and cross-linguistically with <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/people/rubio-fernandez-paula">Paula Rubio-Fernández</a> and <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~hrohde/">Hannah Rohde</a>).


## Research Programme

My research programme, **<i>lifespan pragmatics</i>**, addresses questions at the intersection of experimental pragmatics and cognitive ageing. The aim is to uncover the factors (cognitive, linguistic and social) underlying pragmatic competence (e.g., our ability to read between the lines in conversation and adapt speech in partner-specific ways) at different stages of development.
